# Architecture
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

In the front end of my full-stack project, I used Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA) framework like Angular. Express HTML was used to render static HTML pages, JavaScript for client-side interactions, and Angular for building SPAs. The backend utilized a NoSQL MongoDB database which is ideal for handling unstructured data. MongoDB, being document-oriented, allows manageable storage and retrieval of data without the need for complicated schemas.

# Functionality
How is JSON different from Javascript, and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

JSON is a lightweight file format that is utilized to transfer data between the front end and back end. JSON syntax resembles JavaScript, and it serves as a common language for communication between the front end and backend. Throughout the development of Travlr Getaways, code refactoring was done to improve functionality and efficiency. Refactoring code made the Travlr web application modular, reusable, and easy to maintain. Reusable UI components provide code consistency, more manageable maintenance, and quicker development by reusing code throughout the application.

# Testing
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full-stack application.

API testing includes testing the endpoints to ensure they return the expected responses for various requests. This includes testing HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and verifying that the responses are as expected.
The methods in our Travlr application refer to the HTTP methods used to interact with the API endpoints; for example, GET recovers data, POST creates data, PUT updates data, and DELETE removes data. Endpoints are the URLs revealed by the backend so that the front end can transmit requests. The security for our full-stack application consists of implementing authentication steps to protect sensitive data and ensure that unauthorized users can't gain access.

# Reflection
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

In this course, I have gained valuable knowledge in full-stack web application development using MEAN stack. I have learned how to use Express for backend development, Angular for frontend development, and MongoDB as a NoSQL database. These skills have made me a marketable candidate in the field of data analysis and data science by providing me with a foundation in web development. It has given me a better understanding of how data is transmitted from the front end to the back end. I have a deeper understanding of how data is inputted to the front end and processed through the back end, allowing me to manage data-driven projects.
